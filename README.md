# Caluculatator
A unique and very human calculator that maeks typos. Because why not.

# Setup
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- Then run `npm start` to start the test server
- Go to `localhost:8081` and enjoy!

You may access the app from your phone by scanning the following QR code with Expo Go (the mobile version may occasionally be outdated or broken):

If the QR code leads to a 404 (which it most likely will), you will have to test it locally by your own means.

# Patch notes
