# Caluculatator
A unique and very human calculator that maeks typos. Because why not.

# Setup
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- Then run `npm start` to start the test server
- Go to `localhost:8081` and enjoy!

Please note that this is a mobile app, thus adapted specifically for this platform, and not PC. A QR code is provided in npm's daemon to try out on mobile.

# Patch notes
## 1.0.0
- Added pretty much everything as of now (obviously)
